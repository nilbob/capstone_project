    "As part of the Applied Data Science Capstone Project, I will try to help a vegan, health awareness, ecologically-friendly entrepreneur to find the best location to set up a vegan lifestyle centre in Berlin that includes a vegan food store, an animal-free butchery, coffee shop and a first class vegan restaurant as well as a vegan clothing shop and a yoga studio in one place. To achieve this, I'll scrape Berlin's boroughs and neighborhoods from the <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_Bezirke_und_Ortsteile_Berlins\">Wikipedia Website</a>, to get it's location data to feed it into the Foursquare API to find the most common and frequent venue categories within the neighborhoods and use the k-means clustering algorithm to group the neighborhoods into clusters. \n"

    "According to the independent.co.uk in 2016, \"an estimated 80.000 vegan residents\" (<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/top-10-vegan-cities-travellers-in-world-food-turin-berlin-melbourne-tel-aviv-london-helsinki-a7707031.html\">source</a>) live in Berlin. The Website HappyCow that specialized in finding vegan/vegetarian restaurants around the world with their location based service, crowned Berlin second most popular city for vegans (<a href=\"https://www.happycow.net/vegtopics/travel/top-vegan-friendly-cities\">source</a>) with a vegan hotel, vegan bar, vegan food chain stores, animal-free butchers and more than 50 vegan restaurants (<a href=\"https://www.livekindly.co/berlin-vegan-capital-of-world/\">source</a>). Moreover, Germany has been dominating the market for launching new vegan products between July 2017 and June 2018 with a total share of \"15% of vegan introductions worldwide\" (<a href=\"https://www.mintel.com/press-centre/food-and-drink/germany-continues-to-dominate-global-vegan-new-product-development\">source</a>) and over 14% of the products labeled vegan according to 4% in 2013 (<a href=\"https://www.mintel.com/press-centre/food-and-drink/germany-continues-to-dominate-global-vegan-new-product-development\">source</a>). If we also take into consideration that there is a growth in popularity for veganism and vegetarism worldwide (<a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2018-09/an_exploration_into_diets_around_the_world.pdf\">source</a>) and the potential of the vegan market and peoples' health and ecological awareness (<a href=\"https://www.vegansociety.com/news/media/statistics\">source</a>), tourists are very interested in a place that has it all, where no further travelling from one place to another within the city is involved, especially for the people that short stay in Berlin. Since Berlin has become such a popular city for tourists with around 14 million tourists (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_in_Germany\">source</a>) that come visiting Berlin every year, the potential is high that they'll pay the centre a visit. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Therefore, finding the right spot for opening up a vegan lifestyle centre is vitally important for our business. Since we do not want to target just the tourists, but also the locals, it means we need to focus on boroughs and particular neighborhoods that are not only close to the city centre, but easy to access for locals as well. To avoid too much competition around, we should focus on finding a location that is surrounded by a couple of hotels or accomodations with only a few vegan/vegetarian places or restaurants nearby and not too many yoga studios in that spot. We might not be interested in neighborhoods that are too lively with a lots of activities, such as drinking and entertainment opportunities, since they might not come by to pay the \"calm,relaxed,health-related\"-oriented centre a visit, when going out for a drink etc."

    "1. First of all, I used the table from the <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_Bezirke_und_Ortsteile_Berlins\">Wikipedia Article</a> that lists all 12 boroughs and 96 neighborhoods of Berlin (<a href=\"https://github.com/nilbob/capstone_project/blob/master/boroughs_neighborhoods_berlin.csv\">github_csv_file</a>). Since it was the second table in the article, I struggled to scrape the data from it using beautifulsoup. I also could not load the ressources for <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/\">Pypi Wikipedia</a>. Therefore, I copied the data from the article and created a csv file out of it instead. One option to overcome this challenge would have been to loop through all the tables within the article and choose the one required.\n",
    "I noticed that when I imported the the data from the csv file to pandas dataframe that there has been some hidden \"\\n\" on the Neighborhood column, which needed to be replaced with an empty string to get a proper dataframe out of it. The table looked as follow:<br><br>\n",

    "I checked the amount of top venues available for each neighborhood in Berlin and narrowed it down to the neighborhoods that we were interested in. One can clearly see that the selected neighborhoods all have top100 venues within the region, while some of the more outside of Berlin neighborhoods only have around 20 to 40 venues within the radius of 1500m of its center. This could have to do with the size of the neighborhoods. The city centre is more dense and squeezed in, while the neighborhoods further away from the center are in general bigger and have fewer venues within a certain radius.\n",

    "Finding neighborhoods with similar characteristics based on the venue data from the Foursquare API and clustering them, can be of importance for our business decision, where to set up the vegan centre. This information can be used to focus more on our targeted audience and where they can be found. I\n",
    "For that, I used the unsupervised learning algorithm k-means for clustering the neighborhoods, because it is one of the most popular and commonly used algorithm for partitioning the neighborhoods. It clusters the neighborhoods into groups that share the mostly frequent used venues of interest. This can be of interest when looking for little or no competition in a neighborhood or places of interest nearby that help aquire new customers.\n",
    "The positive aspect of the algorithm is that objects that are within a cluster a very lookalike while the objects in other clusters are very different. So, once found a cluster that suits best, it's very likely that it is not interfering with another one, where it might harm our business. \n",

    "Determining the best number of k in the k-Means clustering algorithm is one of the key aspect of how successfully the outcome of the algorithm will be. Therefore, it is important to find the best k in order to generate the optimum sphere-like clusters shaped around the centroids. There are many other ways to determine the optimum k, like The Silhouette Method. In this case study, I'll focus on the widely known and most popular approach, the Elbow Method. It calculates the sum of squared errors within each cluster. To minimize the error, one needs to find the right spot, where the error will start to diminish. "

    "After checking the numbers of clusters of k=2 and k=3, I found it easier to choose from k=2, when it comes to where to locate the vegan lifestyle centre, because the choices with no vegan restaurants within the cluster 1 for the top15 common venues and less restaurants, means that there is lower competition for us and that is what we were looking for in the first place.\n",
    "When using k=3, the choice is less obvious but still Cluster 1 would be probably the best fit out of the three since the amount of restaurants is lowest, there is no vegan restaurant and the amount of GoingOut venues is lowest in the cluster too. By comparing the two maps (k=2 vs k=3), one can see that Cluster 2 (k=3) falls into Cluster 1 of k=2. That means that when we reduce the cluster by one, all the values from that cluster would fall into the Cluster 1, the one that we wouldn't choose to set up our business. This in turn means that having set k=3 does not give us an extra value or business opportunity and the extra cluster is redundant<br>\n",
    "Looking at the map, one can see that Cluster 1 for k=2 and k=3, is right in the centre of Berlin with all the tourist hotspots and main attraction. Prices for renting out a place to run a business there, might be very high and not optimum. That could also be the reason why there are only exist a few places to eat and drink. This brings us right to the conclusion and discussion section."

    "<b>Conclusion</b><br>\n",
    "Given the data from Wikipedia and the Foursquare API, we could use the unsupervised clustering algorithm k-means to determine the best spot to set up our vegan lifestyle centre business. For k=2 and k=3, the cluster 1 (very centrally located around the borough Berlin Mitte) would be the best fit. While k=3 did not result in an obvious choice, running the elbow method, brought us to the conclusion that the values from the extra cluster fall into the cluster that we wouldn't choose. This means that k=2 was more helpful in figuring out that cluster 1 would be our best fit, since it lead us to a more obvious result to base our decision on.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Discussions on:</b><br>\n",
    "The Business Problem:<br>\n",
    "- We know that the Business model does not only depend on the location (based on clustering), but it has an impact on it. Information, such as rental prices for the cluster as well as the amount of vegan restaurants, which are already there, but not among the most common one, or the activities vegan people prefer, are also relevant and might play a huge roll in setting up the business there or not. This holds also true for yoga studios and hotels nearby. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data:\n",
    "Based on the data from the API, the following questions arise: \n",
    "- how good is the quality of it? how much emphasize can be given on the most common venues in terms of who uses the Swarm, former Foursquare App? Does our target group use the App, are they over represented or under represented in the App. How important are the not so common venues? \n",
    "- How good is the data on new restaurants? Will they appear instantly? Are new places over or underrated?\n",
    "- How accurate is the data from Foursquare? One should check the app with the actual venues in a particular area of interest. \n",
    "- How well did I chose the radius? Is it too big or too small? What impact does it have on our data and cluster?\n",
    "- How well chosen were the neighborhoods? Do we need more or even less neighborhoods to look at? The k-means algorithm works best with fairly big data. Therefore, it might be useful to feed the algorithms with more neighborhoods. \n",
    "- Is there other data available to base our decision on (sources for well-being, income, rental prices, population, socio demographic data)?\n",
    "- Should we pay more attention to other aspects like accomodations and yoga studios?\n",
    "- Are all restaurants are competitors? Maybe, it's good to have some restaurants nearby, because not everyone might be interested in the restaurant, but also in other aspects of the centre (animal free butchery, yoga studio, clothing shop, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A more general question that arises:\n",
    "- Are 80.000 vegan living people, tourists and people, who are interested, enough?\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Outlook</b>:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering Algorithm:<br>\n",
    "- We know that the algorithm's outcome also depends on the distance measurement used, eg. using a different measurement from Euclidien Distance like the Manhattan Distance might lead to another clustering that impacts our business decision. Why not investigate it by trying it out? Maybe, this will change where the values from one cluster would fall into another one if we reduce k by 1.\n",
    "- We should also use an alternative measurement like the silhouette method to find if the optimum is still k=2. \n",
    "Outlook:<br>\n",
    "- Furthermore, we should compare neighborhoods in other cities for example New York, Moscow, London or Tokyo with our data. This will be very interesting when opening or starting a vegan lifestyle centre chain to let our business grow worldwide once set up successfully locally.\n"
